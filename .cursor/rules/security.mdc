## Security Checklist

## Configuration Security

- Store secrets in environment variables or dedicated secret management systems
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Implement secret rotation policies
- Use different credentials for different environments
- Encrypt sensitive configuration values

## Authentication & Authorization

- Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- Use OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect where appropriate
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive operations

## Data Protection

- Encrypt data at rest
- Encrypt data in transit (TLS/HTTPS)
- Implement proper key management
- Sanitize and validate all inputs
- Implement output encoding to prevent XSS attacks
- Apply proper database security controls

## API Security

- Implement rate limiting
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Use API keys/tokens with proper scopes
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Infrastructure Security

- Use container security scanning
- Implement network segmentation
- Apply security hardening to containers and hosts
- Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF) where appropriate
- Implement proper egress filtering

## Logging & Monitoring

- Implement security event logging
- Use centralized log collection and analysis
- Configure alerts for suspicious activities
- Implement audit trails for sensitive operations
- Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information

## Dependency Management

- Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Implement a process for updating vulnerable dependencies
- Use dependency lockfiles for deterministic builds
- Vet third-party libraries before inclusion
- Minimize dependency footprint

## Resilience & Availability

- Implement proper error handling
- Design for graceful degradation
- Protect against DoS attacks
- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Have a tested disaster recovery plan

## SDLC Security

- Perform regular security testing (SAST, DAST, IAST)
- Implement secure code review processes
- Conduct regular penetration testing
- Maintain a vulnerability management program
- Implement proper CI/CD security controls

## Compliance & Governance

- Document security controls
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Conduct regular security awareness training
- Establish incident response procedures
